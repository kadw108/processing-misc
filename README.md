This is a collection of [Processing](https://processing.org/) files I use for making animations.

The majority of these files were used for [Psychedelic Sky Islands, my Rain World animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgfnKtukJiE). So, many files are Rain World-themed.

The main folder is `main`, and the main file there is `main/main.pde`. `main/ARCHIVE.pde` has commented-out code that I used for various effects but no longer want to clog up `main.pde` with. `data` exists to store files that will be read by the Processing code. Currently, only `data/temp.jpg` exists as a demo file. `0rw_data` is a collection of Rain World-related images that are used by some of the Processing code.

The current version of `main/main.pde`, when run, turns `data/temp.jpg` into a series of pixelated karma images as a demonstration of the code in `main/karmaText.pde`.

Owing to the large number of files in the `main` folder, which can be cumbersome in the official Processing editor, you may find it easier to use a different text editor and run the Processing sketch from the command line instead.
